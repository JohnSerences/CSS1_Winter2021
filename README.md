## Course description
This course will introduce new programmers to Python and the Jupyter Notebook environment. No programming experience is necessary as we'll start with the basics. 

This course is focused on getting to actual coding as quickly as possible. To that end, we will focus on function, not theory, and you'll learn how to implement some simple statistical tests and general analysis techniques that many of you will encounter in your course work and in research projects. 

Remember that in programming, unlike some other subject matters, there is no substitute for **experience** and **practice**.   

## Goal of the course
At the end of the course you should have a good understanding of the Python language and the Jupyter environment. We will also cover various packages such as NumPy and Pandas that are commonly used in data science. You should also have some knowledge about the relative strengths and weaknesses of Python and other common languages like Matlab. 

## Lectures and class time
Due to the need for asynchronous learning, I will pre-record a series of short, modular lectures each week and you will be able to watch them at your convenience. Each series of videos will include a brief introduction lecture (usually less than 5 minutes) and then a series of coding tutorials. 

To provide additional support, we will use the class time on Monday @ 8am to go over any questions, problems, or other issues that you may have. I may also go over sections that I think are more challenging in more depth to make sure people understand. I encourage everyone who is able to attend this synchronous sessions, but I will also record them and will make them available on Canvas for those who cannot attend. 

In addition, and because I know not all of you are morning-friendly, I will be having a second synchronous instructional section on XX at XXyyy.  

## Sections

In sections each you will go over examples and practice problems that reinforce the topics covered in the main tutorials. You can also get help from the TAs. Attendance at sections is highly encouraged, as getting more hands on practice and getting help from the TAs will make a huge difference in how much you actually learn from this course and how prepared you are to apply your knowledge in real-world settings.  

## Textbook
There is no required textbook for this course. However, there are many intro books out there that you might find helpful, including the book below that is written for people who are new to python and programming in general. 

Title: Python crash course: a hands-on, project-based introduction to programming
Author: Matthes, Eric

[amazon link here](https://www.amazon.com/Python-Crash-Course-Hands-Project-Based/dp/1593276036/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1546894838&sr=1-1&keywords=Python+Crash+Course%3A+A+Hands-On%2C+Project-Based+Introduction+to+Programming)

There are many other good books as well that may help. Remember though - we are using Python 3, not Python 2, so make sure that any outside resources deal with the correct version. 

## Grading

## Problem sets
Starting week 2 there will be a problem set that you will work on in section and out of class. These assignments are meant to give you the hands-on practice that you need to develop fluency in the language. You must complete 7/9 problem sets (drop the two lowest scores). The problem sets will be graded weekly and will count for 5 points each (35 total). 

### Final Project
Instead of a final exam you will have a final project that will require you to generate code to address a novel problem. More details will be provided during 2nd week. The final project will be worth 50 points. 


## Letter grade in course
Grades will be based on the percentage of points earned on the problem sets and the final project. 

Letter grades will be assigned based on the following table:

A+ 97-100

A 93-96.99999

A- 90-92.99999
 
B+ 87-89.99999
 
B 83-86.99999
 
B- 80-82.99999
 
C+ 77-79.99999
 
C 73-76.99999
 
C- 70-72.99999
 
D+ 67-69.99999
 
D 63-66.99999
 
D- 60-62.99999
 
F 0-59.99999

### Grades will not be rounded.

## Academic Integrity

[From UCSD Academic Integrity office](https://academicintegrity.ucsd.edu/take-action/promote-integrity/faculty/syllabus-statements.html#General-statement-on-academic-i)

"Integrity of scholarship is essential for an academic community. The University expects that both faculty and students will honor this principle and in so doing protect the validity of University intellectual work. For students, this means that all academic work will be done by the individual to whom it is assigned, without unauthorized aid of any kind."

[Please read the full UCSD policy](http://senate.ucsd.edu/Operating-Procedures/Senate-Manual/Appendices/2)

***You must work independently on the problem sets and the final project. Doing work for another student or providing assistance on the problem sets or final project will be treated as a violation of academic integrity and you will be referred for disciplinary action. Similarly, emailing with or otherwise communicating with other students or anyone else during a quiz or exam will be treated as a violation and also referred for disciplinary action.***
